# Tools Repository

This repository contains various tools and scripts for different purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `Pillow` (Python Imaging Library)

## Tools
- The `convert_heic.py` script is designed to convert HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format) files to a more widely supported image format, such as JPEG or PNG. Place the HEIC files in the same directory as the script. The converted files will be saved in the same directory with the same name as the original files, but with the new file extension (e.g., .jpg, .png). When executing the script, define the appropriate file extension by parsing `.jpg` or `.png` as argument.

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries by running the following command: `pip install <librarie>`
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the following command to execute: `python <script> <args>`
